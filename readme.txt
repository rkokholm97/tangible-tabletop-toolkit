This repository will contain a tangible tabletop development toolkit, that allows future researchers
and designers to get started with developing experiences for MultiTaction Cells using Unity3D.

The toolkit will consist of:
	- A manual on setting up the development environment including the MultiTaction table,
 	  TUIO data tracking and Unity.
	- The TUIO simulator as also provided by TUIO.org.
	- An updated version of the Uniducial library
	- A PDF of 4x4 fiducial markers
	- An example project to show the potential of tangible tabletop-based experiences
